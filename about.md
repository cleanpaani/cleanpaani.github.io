Crypto512.com aims at being a one-stop resource for blockchain and bitcoin technology. I am a curious person loves to learn new technologies and teach them to others. In the past, I’ve been an engineer, grad student, R&D scientist, and currently a product manager at a startup.

My goal is to help people learn about blockchain technology, which can truly transform certain aspects of the industry as we know it.

I am always on the lookout for new and interesting applications of blockchain technology - so if you want to exchange ideas or simply get it touch, please send me an email at <a class="u-email" href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a> and let’s get talking.

Thank you!
