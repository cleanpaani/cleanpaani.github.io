When you want to buy a water purifier, the first thing you will notice is the word “TDS” on the product details. Each water purifier will give you different TDS values, they will claim that they have TDS regulators, etc. But what is TDS and how important is this value while choosing a water purifier for your home? Let us fully understand it in this article.

**Total dissolved solids (TDS) is a measure of the amount of minerals, salts or metals dissolved in a given volume of water. In simple terms, it is the measure of the amount of minerals in the water like Magnesium, Calcium, Potassium, Sulphates, etc.**

TDS of water is very important because,
* by measuring the TDS or total dissolved solids in a given amount of water, we can get an idea of water’s purity levels.
* also, we can estimate the quality of the water purifier being used.

Before jumping into TDS measurements, let’s first take a look at how the sediments/solids enter your water source in the first place. 

### **How do solids enter our drinking water?**
As you might already know, most of India’s drinking water comes from our rivers which originate in glaciers or come from rainfall. The river water passes over mud, rocks, plants, etc. and even has sewage effluents being diverted into it. These are the main sources of dissolved solids in water.

Apart from this, the amount of dissolved solids in water increases with rainwater, runoff, industrial waste mixing in river water, corrosion of the water pipelines, etc

As you can see, there is no way to control the dissolved sediments from entering our water sources. Hence, our only solution is to purify the water before consuming it (for drinking or other purposes).

Before choosing a purifier, we first need to check the TDS level in the water. Do you know how TDS is measured?

Let’s see this in the next section.


### **How is TDS measured in water?**

To measure TDS in water, you need a special instrument called a TDS meter. It is a small, compact, handheld instrument that tells you the TDS of your water in units of “ppm”.

You can buy one on Amazon or Flipkart for Rs. 500 or less and it is very useful to own a TDS meter to periodically check on the quality of water being supplied to your house.

Here is a link to a high-quality TDS meter on Amazon (click here to check the price).

### **What is ppm?**
1 ppm indicates 1 milligram of dissolved solids per kilogram of water. So, 500 ppm means that 500 milligrams of dissolved solids are there in 1 kg of water.

### **How does a TDS meter work?**
A TDS meter does not count the number of dissolved sediments directly. It calculates the TDS indirectly by measuring the electrical conductivity of the water. Let’s understand how it does this.

Pure water is actually an insulator – i.e., it will not conduct electricity. This type of water is also called de-ionized water. If you add a little bit of salt in it, it will immediately start conducting electricity!! Do you know why?

It’s because, when there are dissolved elements in water, the number of ions increase – both positive and negative ions (cations & anions). When the number of such free ions increase, then the electrical conductivity increases i.e., the water becomes a better conductor of water.

Thus, by measuring how well the water conducts electricity, the meter will tell you the TDS value of your water in ppm.

> **Summary: if there are dissolved solids in your water, then it will conduct electricity better. By measuring how well the water conducts electricity, the meter will tell you the TDS value of your water in ppm.**

### **What is the acceptable level of TDS in drinking water?**
Minerals can easily dissolve in water and their presence can be detected using a TDS meter. Common TDS limits are 300, 500, 1000 ppm.

According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, a TDS level of 500 ppm is considered as the upper limit for checking if water is good for drinking. 

### **Is TDS good or bad for your health?**
Now that you have an understanding of TDS, how it is measured, and what the different values mean for our health, we can answer the question – is TDS good or bad?

The short answer is – it depends!
* If the TDS value is too low, then your body will not receive the required amount of nutrition from water and your health will suffer.
* If the TDS value is too high, then you are drinking unsafe, impure water.

Ultimately, you need to aim for a TDS value of around 300 – 500 ppm. If your water supply comes within this range, then you are in luck! Else, you have to make a small investment to purify your water and remove some of these dissolved solids.
