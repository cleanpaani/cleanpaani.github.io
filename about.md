Crypto512.com aims at being a one-stop resource for learning blockchain, bitcoin, and cryptocurrency technology. You'll find tutorials starting from the basics and building up to advanced topics. All the material on crypto512.com comes from my personal notes from studying cryptocurrency for a while now. I'll be adding it to the list on a regular (almost daily) schedule - so keep coming back for new material.

About me: I enjoying learning new concepts/technologies and helping others learn them as well. In the past, I’ve been an control systems engineer, a doctoral student, R&D scientist, and currently a lead product manager at a fast-paced tech startup.

I am always on the lookout for new and interesting applications of blockchain technology - so if you want to exchange ideas or simply get it touch, please send me an email at <a class="u-email" href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a> and let’s get talking.

Thank you!
