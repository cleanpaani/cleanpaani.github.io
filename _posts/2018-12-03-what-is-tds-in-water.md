When you want to buy a water purifier, the first thing you will notice is the word “TDS” on the product details. Each water purifier will give you different TDS values, they will claim that they have TDS regulators, etc. But what is TDS and how important is this value while choosing a water purifier for your home? Let us fully understand it in this article.

**Total dissolved solids (TDS) is a measure of the amount of minerals, salts or metals dissolved in a given volume of water. In simple terms, it is the measure of the amount of minerals in the water like Magnesium, Calcium, Potassium, Sulphates, etc.**

TDS of water is very important because,
* by measuring the TDS or total dissolved solids in a given amount of water, we can get an idea of water’s purity levels.
* also, we can estimate the quality of the water purifier being used.

Before jumping into TDS measurements, let’s first take a look at how the sediments/solids enter your water source in the first place. 

### **How do solids enter our drinking water?**
As you might already know, most of the world's drinking water comes from rivers which originate in glaciers or are fed by natural rainfall. During the course of its flow, the river water passes over mud, rocks, plants, has fish and other animals living inside it. It's an entire ecosystem! And all of this contributes to the presence of dissolved solids in the water. 

**Apart from these natural causes, the amount of dissolved solids in water increases with rainwater, sewage runoff, industrial waste mixing in river water, corrosion of the water pipelines, etc.**

Frankly speaking, there is no way to control solids from being dissolved in our water sources. Therefore, our only solution is to purify the water before consuming it (for drinking or other purposes).

**Before choosing a water purifier, we first need to check the TDS level in our water and understand what the TDS level means.**

So, first let us see how to measure the TDS in water in the next section.


### **How is TDS in water measured?**

**To measure TDS in water, you need a special instrument called a TDS meter.** It is a small, compact, handheld instrument that tells you the TDS of your water in units of “ppm”.

TDS meters are not costly - in fact, here is a link to a high-quality TDS meter on Amazon.com that you can use to check the TDS level of your water supply on a regular basis ([click here to check the latest discounted price.](https://www.amazon.in/Digital-Meter-Temperature-Quality-Measurement/dp/B00N7F1NLK/){:target="_blank" .amazon-link})

As I mentioned, a TDS meter reports the TDS value in water in units of ppm. Do you know what ppm stands for?

### **Definition of ppm**
1 ppm indicates 1 milligram of dissolved solids per kilogram of water. So, 500 ppm means that 500 milligrams of dissolved solids are there in 1 kg of water.

### **How does a TDS meter work?**
A TDS meter does not count the number of dissolved sediments directly. In fact - how can you count dissolved solids?? Instead, a TDS meter calculates the TDS by measuring the electrical conductivity of the water.

This technique seems odd - so, let’s understand why a TDS meter uses an indirect method to measure TDS.

First we need to understand that **pure water is an electrical insulator** – i.e., it will not conduct electricity. This type of water is also called de-ionized water. However, if you add a little bit of salt in it, it will immediately start conducting electricity!!

Do you know why? Remember high school chemistry?

It’s because, when there are dissolved elements in water, the number of ions increase – both positive and negative ions (cations & anions). When the number of such free ions increase, then the electrical conductivity increases and the water becomes a better conductor of electricity.

> **Summary: if there are dissolved solids in water, then the water will conduct electricity better. By measuring how well the water conducts electricity, the meter will tell you the TDS value of your water in ppm.**

### **What is the acceptable level of TDS in drinking water?**
So now we know how TDS is measured. If you take a glassful of water from your tap and measure the TDS in it, you will get readings of 200ppm or 300pm, etc. What does this really mean though? Is your water safe for drinking? What are the standards for deciding how safe your water is depending on the TDS value? 

![TDS chart for TDS in water](/imgs/tds-chart.jpg){: .center-image }

According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, a TDS level of 500 ppm is considered as the upper limit for checking if water is good for drinking. So, if you live in an area where the water supply is good and has a TDS of 300 or lower, then you do not have to invest in water purifiers that claim to reduce the TDS 

### **Is TDS good or bad for your health?**
Now that you have an understanding of TDS, how it is measured, and what the different values mean for our health, we can answer the question – is TDS good or bad?

The short answer is – it depends!
* If the TDS value is too low, then your body will not receive the required amount of nutrition from water and your health will suffer.
* If the TDS value is too high, then you are drinking unsafe, impure water.

Ultimately, you need to aim for a TDS value of around 300 – 500 ppm. If your water supply comes within this range, then you are in luck! Else, you have to make a small investment to purify your water and remove some of these dissolved solids.
