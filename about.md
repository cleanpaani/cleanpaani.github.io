Water is vital to our existence. 

We use water from the time we wake up to the time we go to sleep ... for everything. From washing, to bathing, to brushing, to cleaning our cars, to making coffee, to cooking, and the list is endless. 

It is a privilege in today's world to have clean, safe, drinking water flowing out of your home's tap. For most of us, we know that it is necessary to install a water purifier to make the water potable for our family. Thus, choosing a water purifer becomes an important task and the more you are educated about it, the better your choice will be. 

I had to make the same decision and I was confused by the choices in front of me and the terminologies - RO, UV, UF, RO + UV, RO + UV + UF, TDS, germ magnets, filters, etc. Understanding all these acronyms and choices seemed harder than the PhD I have. 

So I decided to note it all down so that it can be helpful to you as well. On CleanPaani.com, you will find in-depth articles on water purifiers and their technologies. I hope I've made it simple for you to figure things out and buy the correct water purifier for your family.
