UV or Ultra-Violet water purifiers are one of the most common types of water purifiers in the market. They work on the principle that germs (bacteria and virus) die when they are exposed to UV radiation. UV water purifiers are generally cheaper than RO (reverse osmosis) water purifiers - but are they really efficient? In this article, let us take a look into how UV water purifies work, their pros & cons, and also see under what circumstances should you buy a UV water purifier.

### **What is UV or Ultra-Violet?**
As we already mentioned, UV water purifiers are based on the fact that UV radiation can kill harmfel germs in our drinking water. So, let us first understand what is UV radiation. 

Scientifically speaking, electro-magnetic radiation is divided into radio waves, microwaves, infra-red radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays. this classification is done based on the wavelength of the radiation. The human eyes can see only that part of the spectrum that falls under the visible light wavelength and anything beyond it cannot be seen by the human eye. 

**The word UltraViolet is a combination of (Ultra = beyond) and the color violet.** Ultraviolet radiation has a wavelength from 10 nm to 400 nm and it is smaller than the wavelength of visible light. UV radiation that is received by the sun's radiation is both useful and harmful to the human body. For e.g., we would not be able to see anything if were not for the sun's radiation reaching the earth. On the same hand, the sun's rays also cause sunburns, suntans and can even cause skin cancer. 

It as discovered in 1801 by German physicist Johann Willhelm Ritter and it was known for many years as a type of radiation that can cause chemical reactions to take place. It was in 1870s that the germicidal (germ killing) property of UV radiation was discovered. 

So why doesn't the UV radiation from the sublight cause harm to us? That is because of the ozone layer. The ozone layer protects us by absorbing harming UV radiations (100 - 280mm wavelength). This range in particular is called Ultra-Violet C or UVC and is used in water purifiers for killing germs. 

### **How is UV radiation produced inside a water purifier?**
Shortwave UV lamps are made using a lamp tube with no phosphor coating composed of fused quartz, since ordinary glass absorbs UVC. These lamps emit ultraviolet light with two peaks in the UVC band at 253.7 nm and 185 nm due to the mercury within the lamp, as well as some visible light. From 85% to 90% of the UV produced by these lamps is at 253.7 nm, whereas only 5–10% is at 185 nm.[citation needed] The fused quartz glass tube passes the 253 nm radiation but blocks the 185 nm wavelength. Such tubes have two or three times the UVC power of a regular fluorescent lamp tube. These low-pressure lamps have a typical efficiency of approximately 30–40%, meaning that for every 100 watts of electricity consumed by the lamp, they will produce approximately 30–40 watts of total UV output. These "germicidal" lamps are used extensively for disinfection of surfaces in laboratories and food-processing industries, and for disinfecting water supplies.
